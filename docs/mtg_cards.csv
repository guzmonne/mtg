"Planets, Spacecrafts, and Station",8,"All-Fates Stalker is such an inspired design and a really clever use of warp. This is already excellent as a 4-drop Banisher Priest, but it also has the mode that lets you flicker a creature for 2 mana by using its warp cost. Flickering is especially good here because you can use it to bypass another warped creature’s delayed exile trigger. This is an excellent card all around and honestly an early pick for mythic uncommon."
Warp,8,"All-Fates Stalker is such an inspired design and a really clever use of warp. This is already excellent as a 4-drop Banisher Priest, but it also has the mode that lets you flicker a creature for 2 mana by using its warp cost. Flickering is especially good here because you can use it to bypass another warped creature’s delayed exile trigger.

Astelli Reclaimer,5,"This looks like it could be quite powerful, but noncreature, nonland permanent cards don’t end up in the graveyard anywhere near as often as every other kind of card. Of course, getting anything back is fantastic, but you need to set it up in some way. It’s nice that Astelli Reclaimer works with spacecraft, which will end up in the graveyard if they become creatures and then trade off."
Auxiliary Boosters,3,"It’s been a while since a vanilla 3/4 flier for 5 mana has been good enough to run. Auxiliary Boosters shows some promise though, as leaving behind a very decent equipment after it dies is a tried and true formula for success."
Banishing Light,5,"Banishing Light is always good to see. This is premium white removal that answers nearly everything. It’s vulnerable to enchantment removal of course, but that shouldn’t deter you from taking it for just about any white deck."
Beyond the Quiet,8,"Board wipes are usually pretty good, and Beyond the Quiet’s exiling is certainly a nice upgrade over your usual wraths. Five mana is expensive enough that you probably won’t be able to afford any follow-up creatures, but this is still something you can play into if you don’t commit too many of your own creatures to the board before you cast it."
Brightspear Zealot,2,"Even in the double spell deck, you presumably won’t double spell every turn. As such, Brightspear Zealot is going to be a 2/4 on the board a lot more often than it’ll be a 4/4. This is fine, but more than likely just filler and definitely not something that pulls you into the archetype."
Cosmogrand Zenith,9,"Double spelling in a turn isn’t too easy to do, but Cosmogrand Zenith rewards you well for doing so. You might be familiar with Cori-Steel Cutter, and this looks uncannily similar. It also pairs really nicely with warp cards, as their cheaper costs help you to trigger it more often. Overall, while this soldier requires some amount of support to get going, most decks should be capable of doing that, so this is just a very strong card."
Dawnstrike Vanguard,2,"I certainly see this being quite powerful on some boards, but it’s such a big investment. Six mana is a lot, and a 4/5 with lifelink is a really lackluster return on that investment. You need to get a bunch of counters out of Dawnstrike Vanguard for it to be worth playing at all, but that’s definitely not a guarantee by the time you get up to 6 mana."
Dockworker Drone,4,"Dockworker Drone ticks a lot of boxes. It’s a 2-drop, it does +1/+1 counter stuff, it’s an artifact creature, and it’s a 2/2 that leaves a counter behind when it dies. Yep, that’s all pretty good for a common 2-drop. No notes."
Dual-Sun Adepts,5,"The ability to buff your team by +1/+1 at instant speed is very potent. As long as you have access to 5 mana, the mere threat of activation makes it very annoying for your opponent to get into combat with your creatures, especially when Dual-Sun Adepts also has double strike. Even by itself, a 2/2 double striker for 3 mana is a good rate on return, so any deck can play this. The wider your board goes, the better this becomes."
Dual-Sun Technique,3,"Combat tricks that draw a card often equate to easy two-for-one plays. The issue is that simply giving a creature double strike in no way guarantees that it can survive the combat. Dual-Sun Technique has high potential, but it needs quite a bit of setup to get there. Some decks will be able to do that, but many others won’t."
Emergency Eject,3,"Stroke of Midnight isn’t a very good card. While it might seem that giving an opponent a Lander token instead of a 1/1 is better for you, that won’t always be the case. Like with Path to Exile, your plans will surely backfire if you cast Emergency Eject too early in the game, since you help your opponent both to accelerate and to fix their colors."
Exalted Sunborn,8,"The ability to double token generation is powerful, but it might not end up all that useful when you draw Exalted Sunborn. As such, it’s good that you get to fall back on this as a 5-mana, 4-power flier with lifelink. The warp ability just gives you a little extra bit of functionality, so you can cast it alongside some other token-creating spell for a bit of value."
Exosuit Savior,3,"Why would you want to use Exosuit Savior to return a permanent you control to your hand? Because it has some kind of ability that triggers when it enters. Straightforward, but not a priority."
Flight-Deck Coordinator,2,"Three mana for a 3/3 really needs a bit more to be worth playing, and sometimes a measly 2 life gained isn’t quite good enough to sell me on it. Flight-Deck Coordinator is certainly playable, but not something you’ll ever go out of your way to pick up."
Focus Fire,4,"Removal that only targets attacking or blocking creatures tends to fall a little short of the mark, but costing 1 mana and dealing at least 2 damage in a vacuum makes Focus Fire more than efficient enough. This works best in more controlling white decks, and the more aggressive ones will probably pass on it."
"Haliya, Guided by Light",6,"Haliya, Guided by Light is a nice little build-around. What stands out the most here is the warp cost, which allows you to cast it alongside something that gives you two creatures/artifacts in one go, at which point you’ve basically gained 3 life and drawn a card for just 1 mana. From there, triggering this at least one more time once you’ve cast Haliya for full price shouldn’t be too hard because just an extra card or two makes this well worth casting."
Hardlight Containment,6,"While Hardlight Containment requires a bit of support to make it work, the ability to exile any creature for just 1 mana is extremely desirable. Just be wary of enchanting an artifact that’s likely to die, like a creature."
Honor,5,"Back in Strixhaven, Guiding Voice ended up as one of white’s best commons and one of the only reasons not to draft a blue deck. While drawing a card is substantially worse than learning, Honor is still quite strong for what it is. The +1/+1 counter deck is going to absolutely love this, but I’d also play it in any white deck."
Honored Knight-Captain,3,"Two mana for two 1/1s is a pretty good deal on its own. I doubt you’ll get to use the 6-mana mode very often, but Honored Knight-Captain is a good enough 2-drop without it."
Knight Luminary,4,"I didn’t like this much at first, but it’s growing on me. A 3/2 plus a 1/1 for 4 mana is fine, though usually you get a little more than that, like flying on one of them. The warp ability is cool, but all you get out of it is a 1/1, which often isn’t going to be worth the mana investment. However, Knight Luminary looks like it’s especially good in red/white, as it’s two bodies in one even when you warp it. You can use both bodies to station a spacecraft, and then all your “control two tapped creatures” abilities are online. I’m sure this’ll be good. White’s archetypes in Edge of Eternities all look like they can make use of this in some way or another."
Lightstall Inquisitor,3,"Lightstall Inquisitor is like a fly buzzing around your head for about 30 seconds. Sure, it’s annoying, but it doesn’t exactly ruin your day. The ability is simply an inconvenience that sometimes won’t even do anything. Still, it’s always good in an aggressive deck as a 1-mana 2/1 with vigilance, but it’s not all that exciting."
Lumen-Class Frigate,6,"Two mana for a Glorious Anthem is a pretty good deal, and you probably only need to station Lumen-Class Frigate once for it to be exactly that. Getting up to 12 charge counters sounds like a pipe dream, but it’s bound to happen on a board stall."
Luxknight Breacher,1,"I really dislike this. How many creatures do you need to make Luxknight Breacher worth it? I’d say at least three or four, which absolutely isn’t a trivial thing to accomplish. Having this in your hand without enough creatures in play sounds absolutely miserable, so I wouldn’t bother running this at all."
Pinnacle Starcage,1,"Hitting everything with mana value 2 or less is extremely restrictive. In your average game, Pinnacle Starcage just isn’t going to hit a lot of permanents, but every now and then you’ll come against a deck that inundates you with valid permanents to exile. This looks like a great sideboard card and nothing more. It’s also a great substitute for Temporary Lockdown now that it’s rotating out of Standard."
Pulsar Squadron Ace,4,"You probably won’t be able to get enough spacecraft to make this a reliable two-for-one, but the ability to fall back on a 2/3 for 2 mana isn’t the worst. I’d absolutely play Pulsar Squadron Ace in any deck with just a couple of potential hits, though I'm not pinning my hopes on it actually hitting something all the time."
Radiant Strike,2,"Radiant Strike can kill a lot of things and the lifegain is a nice touch, but a MV of 4 is far too much. This is essentially a white version of the 5-mana red removal spells we see every set. You’re usually happy with one copy, but it’s never a high priority to pick up. White has better common removal in Edge of Eternities, so you won’t ever need to take this highly."
Rayblade Trooper,5,"A 3/3’s worth of stats for 3 mana is a good base rate. It’s going to be great to have Rayblade Trooper in a deck that cares about those +1/+1 counters. Your opponent is going to have to prioritize fighting over your bigger creatures while this sits back and generates you tokens. Alternatively, you can put the counter on this soldier to make it a 3/3 that dies into a 1/1, and that’s also good to have. Either way, this is a strong card that most white decks should be happy to play."
Reroute Systems,3,"A 1-mana spell that deals 2 damage to a tapped creature is fine, but a bit meh. One mana to give indestructible to something is also just a bit meh. It works often enough, but it doesn’t protect against bounce or exile. Both modes of Reroute Systems are a bit weak, but a charm with the option of one or the other gives you a good amount of flexibility that probably makes this a good, playable card."
Rescue Skiff,1,"When I put a 6-drop anything into my deck, I want to know that it does something when I cast it. You don’t have that guarantee with Rescue Skiff. Not only might you not have any target in your graveyard at all, but if you happen to have one, it might not be worth reanimating for 6 mana. This spacecraft is quite large if you can station it, but getting to 10 charge counters sounds like far too much to be worth going for."
Scout for Survivors,4,"If all you can do is reanimate one creature with a +1/+1 counter, Scout for Survivors likely isn’t worth running. Once you have a few 1-drops to enable this and get back two or even three creatures, you might be on to something. I’d want to have those in my deck first, because trading them off early and then playing this for a big tempo swing sounds pretty incredible."
Seam Rip,5,"While Seam Rip can only answer a small handful of targets, it’s a good, clean answer to those targets. It’s particularly effective against tokens, since they’ll never come back. We saw this exact card a while back in the form of Portable Hole, and I assume this’ll be just as good this time around."
The Seriema,6,"This will be a big test for the station mechanic overall. The question is simply whether you’d run The Seriema in your deck with no legendary creatures to search for. Three mana for a 5/5 flier is of course very strong, but it sounds like a little too much work to station it with seven charge counters. I’m only interested in playing this with a good target or two to search for. But if it’s easier to station a spacecraft than I think, I could easily play this with no targets thanks to its efficiency."
Squire’s Lightblade,1,"Did you ever play Coral Sword in Final Fantasy? I know I didn’t. Not only that, but Squire's Lightblade is even worse, as it has a higher equip cost. Kindled Fury is a combat trick that has seen moderate levels of play whenever it shows up, but it’s getting worse as the years go on and is now far too narrow. I just don’t see this new variant as remotely playable."
Starfield Shepherd,6,"I talk a lot about the need to find opportunities for two-for-ones, so you know I’m going to be interested in a three-for-one! Starfield Shepherd guarantees you multiple land drops and a bunch of card advantage, which is very valuable, especially in the early game."
Starfighter Pilot,3,"Starfighter Pilot is a nice, solid 2-drop that gives you some very real advantage. It gets outclassed fairly quickly, but you’ll still be able to trigger it as the game progresses by using it to station your spacecraft."
Starport Security,3,"Four mana to tap a creature is laughably weak, but 2 mana is a lot closer to being realistic. I’d want to be in the +1/+1 counters deck before I’d want Starport Security, but the fact that it’s also a 1-drop means it’ll probably be quite desirable in that deck."
Sunstar Chaplain,7,"Whether you attack or station something, having two tapped creatures around on your end step feels nearly free. Sunstar Chaplain is also just a nice, aggressive creature regardless of whether you’re using its ability or not. The kicker here is the ability to tap several creatures in one turn; with enough counters available to you, you’ll be able to tap down an entire team of blockers before your final attack. That’s very dangerous potential to have on your side, and I’d expect this to shine particularly in any +1/+1 counter focused deck."
Sunstar Expansionist,5,"It’s not going to be worth skipping your land drop for a turn just to enable Sunstar Expansionist, which means it’s going to be a lot stronger when going second than when going first. What’s good is that this cleric is essentially a 3/3 for 2 mana, so it’s big enough on its own that you’re happy to play it no matter what. It just happens to be a lot stronger when you go second."
Sunstar Lightsmith,6,"I’m preconditioned not to like Hill Giants at all. However, Sunstar Lightsmith’s ability is extremely good. Drawing a card is always going to be among the best possible payoffs for a Draft archetype, and even though this is a tad too expensive, it should be well worth it in your double spell deck."
Wedgelight Rammer,2,"Wedgelight Rammer looks awful to me. Getting to nine charge counters sounds like far too much to be able to do reliably. It makes me think that I must be missing some kind of trick here, because I trust that WotC have designed these cards somewhat competently. I’ll try it out at first and see if I’m wrong, but I just don’t like this design at all."
Weftblade Enhancer,1,"Six-drops need to be particularly good to see any play, and Weftblade Enhancer looks far too weak for that. Without warping it, it’s a 5/6‘s worth of stats for 6 mana, which is awful. If you warp it, you get two extra +1/+1 counters, but it costs you another 3 mana to do so. This just looks massively over-costed with nowhere near enough payoff for it."
Zealous Display,2,"Trumpet Blast has been playable at times, and white does have a go-wide archetype to benefit from Zealous Display. You won’t want multiple copies, but the first is probably fine, assuming you’re aggressive enough to want it."
Annul,3,"Edge of Eternities has a fairly heavy artifact theme, so you’re bound to find a use for at least the first copy of Annul. If you’re lucky enough to get multiple copies, I’d probably only start one. The rest can be great sideboard cards, but that sentiment is likely to change as the format evolves."
Atomic Microsizer,3,"I’m not quite getting the design here. Is there an inherent advantage to making one of your creatures a 1/1 that can’t be blocked? I think the “can’t be blocked” clause is something that a lot of players will overrate, but hitting for 1 damage, or 2 if you equip the creature with Atomic Microsizer, isn’t particularly consequential. You can shrink an opponent's creature instead, but that's not affecting the grade much. This is still a 1-drop artifact, which is probably relevant for the format, but I want a little bit more out of the effect like the ability to use it with some sort of combat damage trigger."
Cerebral Download,3,"Controlling an artifact sounds extremely easy to accomplish, so let’s just look at this as always being a vanilla 2/4 flier. That’s honestly not bad. After all, Wind Drake has been a very playable card in the past. Yeah, I can see playing Cloudsculpt Technician in any deck with an abundance of artifacts."
Cloudsculpt Technician,3,"Controlling an artifact sounds extremely easy to accomplish, so let’s just look at this as always being a vanilla 2/4 flier. That’s honestly not bad. After all, Wind Drake has been a very playable card in the past. Yeah, I can see playing Cloudsculpt Technician in any deck with an abundance of artifacts."
Codecracker Hound,7,"Who else remembers Sibsig Appraiser? Or Organ Hoarder? These blue creatures are always excellent as they’re just the simplest way to get a good two-for-one advantage. Warp pushes Codecracker Hound way over the top because it allows you to get a whole extra card out of the deal if you have the time to spend on doing so. I’d be very surprised if this weren’t one of blue’s best cards in Edge of Eternities, and I will be taking it very highly in Draft."
Consult the Star Charts,5,"Consult the Star Charts is really mediocre at 2 mana, but at 4 mana it’s basically an instant speed Stock Up. That’s pretty good and a draw spell I’d be very happy to run."
Cryogen Relic,4,"Ichor Wellspring was one of my favorite cards from back in the day, so I’m really excited to see this here. It shouldn’t be too hard to get your full value out of Cryogen Relic, ideally by sacrificing it for some kind of other ability, but having its own buyout option is a nice backup plan for that. Quick reminder that the activated ability doesn't tap anything down, it just stuns a creature that's already tapped."
Cryoshatter,5,"This is some pretty good removal for blue. Unlike similar cards from the past like Sensory Deprivation, the enchanted creature can only block once before it takes damage and is destroyed. I really like Cryoshatter. It’s cheap, efficient, and very effective. It’s also really cool flavor-wise, as you can imagine the idea is that the creature has been frozen and you’ve then shattered it."
Desculpting Blast,4,"I’m always a fan of bounce spells with no particular targeting restrictions. Their flexibility gives you so much agency over playing them that there are all sorts of good plays you can make. Since Desculpting Blast rewards you more for bouncing an attacking creature, the best play you could make is to block an attacking creature and then bounce it in response to a combat trick or something similar."
Divert Disaster,3,"Quench is a fine card in Limited these days. Getting a rebate of a Lander token if they can pay for it isn’t relevant at all, because by the time they can pay for their spell, you’re not going to need more lands. Whatever, Divert Disaster is a fine 2-mana counterspell, and I’m sure it’ll be reasonable to play."
Emissary Escort,4,"It’s not hard to imagine Emissary Escort simply being a 4/4 or bigger from the midgame onwards. That’s decent, but ultimately it’s just a big, cheap vanilla creature and nothing more. Unless you’re high rolling with some big warped artifact on turn 3 (like Bygone Colossus), this should only be a little above average."
Gigastorm Titan,4,"This is pretty cool. You obviously never want to cast Gigastorm Titan for full price; it really ought to cost 2 mana. The double spell deck needs plenty of options for cheap spells to enable their cards, and this does do that. This is also just a good tempo play in any deck that runs cheap spells that can enable it. This elemental is still just a cheap vanilla creature at the end of the day, so it’s not broken or anything, but it does look like a good playable."
Illvoi Galeblade,4,"I love cheap flash fliers like this. You can get a little bit of damage in if you play Illvoi Galeblade early or happen to play it on a board with no fliers. Later in the game, you can just block a big creature and sacrifice this to draw a card. This is great, and a nice common to see."
Illvoi Infiltrator,4,"We’ve seen this exact design a couple of times in the past, like with Nimble Brigand or Gateway Sneak, and it’s usually quite good. Double spelling in a turn is considerably harder to do than committing a crime or playing a gate was, but Illvoi Infiltrator is worth playing even if you only get one card off of it."
Illvoi Light Jammer,3,"Countering a removal spell for 2 mana has played out pretty well in the past, and you can also use Illvoi Light Jammer as a combat trick if needed. The fact that this leaves behind an equipment to buff your other creatures too means I’d be pretty happy to play this in most decks."
Illvoi Operative,2,"Illvoi Operative is a pretty weak payoff for the double spell deck, but it isn’t completely embarrassing to run if you have to. At least it’s a 2-drop, so it’s easy to fit into your curve and also cheap enough to enable the archetype."
Lost in Space,4,"Ice Magic, Riverwalk Technique, Trip Up, and many others. The 4-mana instant that lets you put a creature to the top or bottom of the deck is a tried and tested formula at this point that we know should be good. Lost in Space is just one of the better and most flexible ways that blue has to deal with creatures in Edge of Eternities."
Mechan Assembler,5,"I don’t like that this is just a vanilla 4/4 the turn you play it, but if it survives you’ll be able to get quite a lot of free advantage over the next few turns. Mechan Assembler reminds me a lot of Saruman the White, which looked really weak at first but ended up being a very strong build-around in the Lord of the Rings format."
Mechan Navigator,3,"I love the 3/3 defenders for 2 mana that we usually see, but having just 2 toughness makes Mechan Shieldmate quite a bit worse. However, it attacks a lot more freely than other variants of this effect. This reminds me the most of Shipwreck Sentry from The Lost Caverns of Ixalan, which often felt more like a 2-mana 3/3 vanilla in the right deck and was very good in the set. I assume this will also be quite strong, especially in the blue/red aggro decks."
Mechan Shieldmate,3,"I love the 3/3 defenders for 2 mana that we usually see, but having just 2 toughness makes Mechan Shieldmate quite a bit worse. However, it attacks a lot more freely than other variants of this effect. This reminds me the most of Shipwreck Sentry from The Lost Caverns of Ixalan, which often felt more like a 2-mana 3/3 vanilla in the right deck and was very good in the set. I assume this will also be quite strong, especially in the blue/red aggro decks."
Mechanozoa,3,"We just saw Ice Flan do a decent amount of work in Final Fantasy, and this is bound to be similar. Mechanozoa may not be able to islandcycle, but getting to cheekily tap down a creature for 3 mana while possibly stationing a spacecraft is a nice bonus on an otherwise decent 6-drop."
Mental Modulation,3,"Pressure Point is kind of mediocre whenever we see it, but it’s still the kind of card you don’t mind to play in a pinch. The cost reduction here is a big upgrade though, because now you have a 1-mana cantrip on your turn that sounds really good for enabling the double spell archetype. I’d absolutely play as many copies of Mental Modulation as I could find in that deck, and it’s a defensible pick for other decks too."
"Mm’menon, the Right Hand",7,"We’re probably going to have to get used to pronouncing this name, because Mm'menon, the Right Hand is a great bomb rare for any artifact-based deck. The ability to cast artifacts from the top of your library essentially equates to free cards drawn. This is a big card advantage engine assuming you have enough artifacts, but even casting just one or two for free is enough to make this worthwhile."
Moonlit Meditation,0,"Spending a whole card to upgrade some of your tokens isn’t all that exciting. It requires too much setup. You need lots of token creators and something worth upgrading them into. On top of that, your opponent can just blow you out by killing the enchanted permanent. Players are already talking about Moonlit Meditation for combo potential in Constructed formats, but it just doesn’t work in Limited."
Mouth of the Storm,4,"Bewildering Blizzard this is not. Mouth of the Storm should have a big impact on the board when you play it, but often the sizes of your creatures just won’t be able to line up in such a way to fully utilize the effect. Ultimately, I think it’ll fall short of being impressive a little too often, but it’s still an okay finisher."
Nanoform Sentinel,2,"This is an interesting card. On the face of it, Nanoform Sentinel doesn’t look very good, but the context of being able to station a spacecraft and then untap something else that can station it sounds like it might have some legs. I don’t think that’s good enough, but I could definitely be proven wrong by the right deck."
Quantum Riddler,9,"Oh hi, Mulldrifter, how’ve you been? While Quantum Riddler usually draws you just one card instead of two, Mulldrifter didn’t let you cast it a second time from exile after you evoked it. It also wasn’t a 4/6. My apologies, I love Mulldrifter and I’m not looking to disrespect it, but this new version looks like it might be even better. It certainly should be in Limited."
Scour for Scrap,3,"Typically, searching for a specific card from your deck isn’t playable in Limited. We wouldn’t choose to play Fabricate if we could help it. However, the ability to choose both modes of Scour for Scrap makes this a 4-mana draw two, which is definitely within the range of playability. On top of that, it draws you good cards. I quite like this, though I don’t think I’d ever run more than one copy."
Selfcraft Mechan,3,"There are a few nice things that you can easily sacrifice to enable Selfcraft Mechan, like a Nutrient Block or Cryogen Relic. If you have some of those, this looks quite good, but you need to have that support in place because a vanilla 3/4 for 4 is nowhere near good enough."
Sinister Cryologist,1,-3/-0 for one turn at sorcery speed is incredibly weak. You might be able to make an attack look more appealing but that’s about it. Sinister Cryologist isn’t something I’d ever look to play.
Specimen Freighter,6,"Even for 6 mana, bouncing two creatures in one go is a very powerful tempo swing. While it requires stationing, Specimen Freighter has the potential essentially to be a Marang River Regent, just with a couple of extra steps. If those steps are worth doing, this could be an extremely powerful card in Edge of Eternities Limited."
Starbreach Whale,3,3/5 is quite big for a common 5-drop flier. You even get to surveil 2 for good measure and get a free surveil for 2 mana earlier in the game if you have the spare mana to warp your Starbreach Whale. Not a bad little deal all things considered.
Starfield Vocalist,3,"It shouldn’t be too difficult to finding some good enters the battlefield abilities to work with Starfield Vocalist. My only issue is that this isn’t worth playing unless you have enough of those to reliably believe that you’re going to draw them together. The fact that this is well below par without anything to go along with it means that it really needs a lot of support to be worth playing. It should be good enough if you find enough abilities for it, though."
Starwinder,8,"Don’t these effects normally come with restrictions? “Do this only once each turn”? “Whenever one or more”? No, Starwinder comes at you completely unimpeded, and you can draw all the cards! If you have an attack lined up with a trample or evasive creature, casting this for 4 mana might just be a Concentrate or better. You could also cast this for its warp cost, station a spacecraft, and immediately attack with it to draw a bunch of cards for your trouble. Not to mention that in each of these scenarios, you also get to cast this for 7 mana later on. This is very powerful, and I look forward to drafting it."
Steelswarm Operator,5,"I always like blue’s random archetype-specific mana dorks and this is no exception. On the whole, Steelswarm Operator looks a bit worse than something like Oaken Siren, but I’m not going to complain about the ability to cast 4-mana artifacts on turn 3."
Synthesizer Labship,6,"This is a really interesting card. Your typical Claustrophobia variant always suffers from the downside of leaving your opponent with their creature on the battlefield so they can still use its abilities or find some way of getting rid of the aura. This version, for just 1 extra mana, allows you to make use of that creature’s abilities instead. While I’m not sure how often that’s going to come up, Tractor Beam is still quite a bit better than your usual blue removal and likely a very strong card in EOE Limited."
Tractor Beam,6,"This is a really interesting card. Your typical Claustrophobia variant always suffers from the downside of leaving your opponent with their creature on the battlefield so they can still use its abilities or find some way of getting rid of the aura. This version, for just 1 extra mana, allows you to make use of that creature’s abilities instead. While I’m not sure how often that’s going to come up, Tractor Beam is still quite a bit better than your usual blue removal and likely a very strong card in EOE Limited."
Unravel,2,"This isn’t much more than just a typical Cancel. The ability to draw a card sometimes is a very good upside, but it only really works if you counter a warped spell. For all the times that’ll come up, there are a few more times when it won’t. If you didn’t want a 3-mana counterspell in the first place, you won’t want Unravel. Edge of Eternities Limited needs to be slow for this to be worth running at all, and only time will tell if that’s the case."
Uthros Psionicist,4,"Cost reductions aren’t usually that enticing, but a 2-mana discount could very well be. The double spell deck could certainly utilize Uthros Psionicist’s cost reduction and make it a lot easier to trigger its cards. I don’t see any other deck caring about this, but that’s exactly what a good build-around is for anyway."
Uthros Scanship,4,"This looks remarkably similar to Sidequest: Card Collection from Final Fantasy. While that card looked quite weak at first, it ended up being very solid in a lot of blue decks. Uthros Scanship isn’t nearly as good but it ticks a lot of the same boxes, so I’m sure it’ll find a home."
Weftwalking,6,"Okay, this is a weird one. Have we ever had a one-sided Timetwister before? Probably, but I don’t remember one. Since Weftwalking isn’t symmetrical like these cards usually are, this is effectively just a 6-mana draw seven. You then have this enchantment that lets your opponent cast a free spell each turn sitting around, which is probably not the worst thing for you given that they probably have access to very few cards at this point in the game. Overall, the downside isn’t too bad for you and the upsides more than make up for it."
"Alpharael, Stonechosen",3,"Alpharael’s mythic version looks really nasty at first. An annoying life loss trigger for your opponent plus a heavily punishing ward cost should add up to a really powerful card. Emphasis there on “should”. Alpharael, Stonechosen is also a 3/3 for 5 mana with no evasion that has to attack and have void enabled to actually do anything. While it doesn’t look unplayable to me, I think it falls well short of where you want to be."
Archenemy’s Charm,6,"All three modes here are excellent and are good at different points of the game. It’s just casting it that’s the problem. I’d still go for Archenemy's Charm and try to skew my mana base towards black if I did, but you still have to be aware that this is most likely to be live from about turn 6 or 7 onwards."
Beamsaw Prospector,3,"We’ve had creatures in the past like Dire Fleet Hoarder and Undercity Dire Rat that create a Treasure when they die, and they’ve always been fine. I think getting a Lander token may actually be better than that, so I can definitely see playing Beamsaw Prospector, especially in the sacrifice deck."
Blade of the Swarm,1,"Okay, this is a cute effect to have but it’s far too narrow. I don’t want to play a 5/3 for 4 mana, so Blade of the Swarm really hinges on the ability to snipe a warped card from exile. I think this is a sideboard card more than anything, and I wouldn’t want to start it in the main deck until proven otherwise."
Chorale of the Void,1,"There are so many downsides with Chorale of the Void. Where should I begin? Firstly, auras often suck because they open you up to getting blown out by a removal spell. This only reanimates creatures from your opponent’s graveyard, so you can’t even set it up like you can when you reanimate from your own graveyard. It’s highly situational, and there’s very little you can do to change that? I’m not buying it."
Comet Crawler,3,"Attacking as a 4/3 lifelink is actually very strong. Lifelink is among the most important abilities in Limited because it’s so effective at winning damage races for you. You do need to support Comet Crawler, but it’s probably a decent card if you can do so."
Dark Endurance,1,"Tricks like Dark Endurance are always mediocre. Sure, they can obviously work and kill something else in combat, but they’re just too situational most of the time."
Decode Transmissions,4,"While the void ability is a nice bonus, I look at Decode Transmissions as a simple Divination that’ll lose me some life. That’s still really good, and I’m happy to fire it off for that whenever I need to."
Depressurize,5,"This card is brilliant. Cheap, efficient, and full of flavor. Depressurize is likely to be black’s best common early on and definitely something to look out for in Draft. It’s notably worse than just -3/-3 because it’s less effective as a combat trick, but that shouldn’t be enough to hold it back."
Dubious Delicacy,7,"Removal plus a very tangible bonus is always very good. Being an artifact, you can get value when you sacrifice Dubious Delicacy, perhaps by returning it to your hand and reusing it, turning it into a creature, or all sorts of other things. It’s a tad on the expensive side, but this will still be premium removal in the set."
Elegy Acolyte,10,"I remember first reading this card when it was initially leaked. We’re in the middle of a heatwave in the UK, so it was the middle of the night (about 4 A.M.) and I couldn’t sleep, so I randomly checked my phone and saw Elegy Acolyte. I simply thought to myself, “Yep, that’s a 10 for the set review.” And yeah, here we are."
Embrace Oblivion,4,"Bone Splinters variants always perform well when there’s a good sacrifice deck for it to go into. Embrace Oblivion isn’t premium removal given how you have to enable it, but it’s a key piece of this particular archetype that you might have enough ways to enable in other black decks."
Entropic Battlecruiser,7,"The usual “assassin” design of a card that finishes off a damaged creature never ends up being very good. What we have here might be the best version we've ever seen, as Faller's Faithful also has the ability to trade one of your own creatures for two new cards. Back in the day, Fell Stinger was a phenomenal card and this might be even better."
Faller’s Faithful,7,"The usual “assassin” design of a card that finishes off a damaged creature never ends up being very good. What we have here might be the best version we've ever seen, as Faller's Faithful also has the ability to trade one of your own creatures for two new cards. Back in the day, Fell Stinger was a phenomenal card and this might be even better."
Fell Gravship,6,"I always love seeing Gravedigger-style effects. You immediately get a good card back from your graveyard and are left with a relevant permanent on the battlefield. Stationing Fell Gravship will take a while, but this does eventually become a very annoying creature, so it’s well worth doing. This is also remarkably similar to Carrion Cruiser, which was an excellent card in Aetherdrift."
Gravblade Heavy,1,"Four-drops that look this weak often don’t perform well. Deathtouch just gets less and less relevant on bigger creatures, so Gravblade Heavy is little better than a conditional vanilla creature."
Gravkill,4,"We’ve seen this time and time again and it’s always good. Four mana to cleanly exile any creature, and in this case any spacecraft. Gravkill is good, and you’ll be happy with any you can pick up. It just lacks a little bit of efficiency that cheaper removal tends to offer."
Gravpack Monoist,5,"A 2/1 flier that dies into a 2/2 sounds great to me. Even better, Gravpack Monoist only costs 3 mana, and I’d have thought it would cost 4. While the obvious play is to run this in a sacrifice deck, this is efficient enough that I’d be happy to play it in any black deck."
Hullcarver,3,"I say this in every set review, but a 1-mana creature with deathtouch is just good. I love to see them; they’re great defensive options and they’re relevant on nearly every board. Hullcarver is just very nice to see."
Hylderblade,4,"The idea of getting this to attach to your creatures for free is quite interesting. The downside is that it happens at the end of your turn. You can attack with a buffed creature and trade it off in combat, and Hylderblade will move to something else when you end the turn. I never want to manually attach this, so I think it’ll be mostly used in the sacrifice deck to enable it more easily."
Hymn of the Faller,5,"The ability to draw two cards for 2 mana is a great deal, and one definitely worth going for. While you can fire off Hymn of the Faller to just draw one card in a pinch, you probably should hold off for as long as possible and hope to trade something off and get an extra card for your troubles. Of course, the fact that you have that bail out option makes this nice and flexible, and I’m sure this’ll be a strong card in EOE Limited."
Insatiable Skittermaw,1,"A Gray Ogre with menace just isn’t good enough on its own. You need to enable void to make this a remotely playable card, and I’m not willing to put that effort in. The sacrifice deck looks like it has a lot of good things going for it, but I don’t think Insatiable Skittermaw is one of them."
Lightless Evangel,4,"Unlike similar creatures in the past, Lightless Evangel only triggers when you sacrifice something, not when anything dies. That’s quite a big difference, but not one that the sacrifice deck will actually care about. As such, you’ll love to play this vampire in that deck, but your average black deck can probably skip on it."
Monoist Circuit-Feeder,7,"This is bound to be one of my favorite cards in Edge of Eternities. Gotta love a Nekrataal that’s also a big threat. Yes, Monoist Circuit-Feeder needs some support, but you’re bound to have at least a couple of artifacts out by the time you cast this, and it should be able to kill most things. The +X/+0 part is also very relevant, allowing you either to make a big attack that you wouldn’t be able to otherwise or simply to put a lot of charge counters onto a spacecraft."
Monoist Sentry,4,"This is a great design, and I love it. Monoist Sentry will probably play out very similarly to a 1-drop with deathtouch, as it can trade for a lot of creatures in combat. But the gimmick here is that its high power makes it very good at stationing spacecraft. And fun fact, this is only the fourth creature in Magic’s history, with the exception of things like double-faced cards and vehicles, to cost 1 mana and have 4 or more power (alongside Phyrexian Dreadnought, Death's Shadow, and Vexing Devil)."
Perigee Beckoner,1,"Common 5-drops are incredibly replaceable, and I don’t see Perigee Beckoner bucking that trend. This ability is just a lot worse when your opponent can see it coming, so I don’t see this being very good at all."
Requiem Monolith,8,"There’s a lot of text here, but it essentially translates to a Phyrexian Arena over which you have more control. All you need is a creature with at least 2 toughness to target with it. This black artifact then has the extra bonus of letting you draw a bunch more cards if the creature you targeted gets into combat. That alone would be very good, but it has another aspect to it: It can target your opponents’ creatures too! They can decline to ping their own creature, but the triggered ability you give to the creature is mandatory, so if you target an opponent’s creature and then deal a large amount of damage to it, your opponent is forced to lose that much life. That’s not going to happen very often, but it does mean that if Requiem Monolith is in my deck, I’m much more likely to want a Pinnacle Kill-Ship."
Scrounge for Eternity,1,"Reanimate spells tend to be a bit weak in Limited, and Scrounge for Eternity has a lot less going for it. This one even costs you a creature or artifact and barely even gives you a mana advantage on cheating something out. It’s not unplayable, but it’s far from being good."
"Sothera, the Supervoid",10,"A Grave Pact that exiles is something that any sacrifice-themed deck would love to have. Even a deck not built around sacrifices can utilize Sothera, the Supervoid, since even trading off creatures in battle triggers it. This legendary enchantment also punishes your opponents for killing your creatures. The second ability is also great, even though you might miss having it around. Overall, I think this is just absurd. Turning one-for-ones into two-for-ones is a very appealing effect, and it even turns itself into a big creature for you to win the game with."
Sunset Saboteur,3,"Oh boy. I knew right away this would be difficult to evaluate. Sunset Saboteur dies to every removal spell, but the ward cost guarantees you a two-for-one. Four power and menace is a really nasty combination, but that’s where the upsides stop. The fact that this has to buff one of your opponent’s creatures is terrible for you. Imagine your opponent has a pair of 2/2s to block with. Now, they have a 2/2 and a 3/3, and you’ll only trade for one of them. You also can’t attack into any first strike creature. I just don’t think this is worth playing very often, but it’s randomly very good against slower decks that don’t have all that many creatures."
Susurian Dirgecraft,4,"Five mana is a lot to pay for an edict effect like this, but it does come with a reasonable spacecraft attached to it. Susurian Dirgecraft just seems like a decent card. Nothing too flashy or broken, just solid value."
Susurian Voidborn,6,"Blood Artist variants are excellent alongside a sacrifice theme, and this one shouldn’t disappoint. I don’t think the warp cost matters all that much, but it’s cheap enough that if you know you’re going to sacrifice something, you can cheat Susurian Voidborn in and get some free value for your trouble."
Swarm Culler,3,"A flying creature like Swarm Culler should be easy to tap and trigger. You could always station something if your attacks don’t line up well, too. This trigger is definitely worth trying to enable, as the sacrifice decks should have plenty of fodder to fuel it and drawing cards is always good."
Temporal Intervention,1,"Temporal Intervention is far closer to Coercion than it is to Thoughtseize, but even the latter wouldn’t play out that well in Limited. These sorts of cards are often decent sideboard options that you never want in your main deck, though they tend to be more powerful in Sealed since people will have more bomb rares than usual."
Timeline Culler,4,"Timeline Culler is a card with a lot of potential. This is good and cheap at enabling a lot of black’s themes in Edge of Eternities. It’s also great to sacrifice, as you can warp it from the graveyard, sacrifice it, cast it from exile, sacrifice it, warp it again, and so on. Each other go around costs life, but having access to as many creatures to sacrifice as you can afford is really nice."
Tragic Trajectory,7,"Not being an instant might hold Tragic Trajectory back a little, but -2/-2 is still good enough to kill most creatures in the first couple of turns. If you can enable the void ability, the ability to kill just about anything for 1 mana is a huge upside, so this is one of the most efficient removal spells you’re going to see."
Umbral Collar Zealot,6,"In a game where everything costs mana, getting to do anything useful for free is something you should always pay attention to. Sacrificing something for free absolutely falls into this camp, and Umbral Collar Zealot is of the most premium cards for any kind of sacrifice deck. It’s also just a well-statted creature anywhere."
Virus Beetle,4,"When Virus Beetle was first printed in Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty, it ended up being one of the best commons in the set. Since then, black 2-drop creatures that force your opponent to discard have stood out in almost every set in which they’ve been printed. Granted, Kamigawa had a lot of synergies with both ninjutsu and artifacts to make Virus Beetle stand out in the way that it did, but it’s still going to be a good and highly sought-after common in Edge of Eternities."
Voidforged Titan,4,"Five-drops that do nothing aren’t exactly at the top of my wish list. Void doesn’t seem too difficult to enable, but how likely can you enable it on the same turn you play Voidforged Titan so you can draw a card right away? I don’t think it’ll happen all that often, but this has some potential if you can set it up correctly."
Vote Out,6,"Are there any Among Us fans out there? I love the flavor of this card, and it’s also extremely good. Four mana to destroy any creature is already fine, but convoking your creatures to cast Vote Out lets you fit it into a lot more places on your curve. It also enables the various creatures that have abilities that trigger when they become tapped, so that’s definitely something to watch out for."
"Xu-Ifit, Osteoharmonist",8,"We’ve seen cards similar to Xu-Ifit, Osteoharmonist in the past, but with a lot more guardrails in place to stop it being silly. The only real downside here is that the creature you reanimate has no abilities. That’s literally it. Otherwise, you can just continue to reanimate a creature, trade it in combat or sacrifice it, then get it back again next turn. This creature can provide you a constant stream of fodder and at no real cost, so it’s it a very difficult creature to play against."
Zero Point Ballad,9,"You need to take a long, hard look at any board wipe that can become a Plague Wind. While Zero Point Ballad costs you a fairly decent chunk of life, this should clear up most boards very easily. You may even be able to pick a value for X that leaves you with a creature or two and your opponent with none. This is of course even easier to enable if you can choose a big enough value of X and get one of those creatures back. The life loss and the mana investment keep this in check to some extent, but the raw power level is definitely here."
Bombard,4,"Four damage for 3 mana is very reasonable. We’ve seen Bombard a few times before and it’s always fine; it’s just good, clean removal."
Cut Propulsion,6,"Cut Propulsion is essentially a red Murder in the vast majority of cases. Every similar card we’ve seen in the past has been very playable, and I don’t see any reason why this wouldn’t be now."
Debris Field Crusher,4,"This isn’t quite the Flametongue Kavu that it could be. Five mana for 3 damage is really inefficient, and the spacecraft you get is really weak for the resources that you have to expend to station it. Debris Field Crusher is by no means bad because it’s still a two-for-one, but it’s definitely borderline."
Devastating Onslaught,5,"Casting Devastating Onslaught as a Heat Shimmer sounds like a losing play to me. Once you get to 5, 7, or even more mana, then you’re in business. You also want something worth copying, but there are a ton of good enters triggers for you to utilize, and you can also copy some big creature and make a big swing with your hasty tokens. There are a lot of ways to get good value from this, though it’s still a heavily situational card even with that support in place."
Drill Too Deep,3,"Artifact removal is very likely worth running in your main deck, so I’d be happy to run at least the first copy of Drill Too Deep. I don’t think you’ll choose the first mode all that often, but it’s very nice to have it there and randomly attack your opponent with a spacecraft."
Frontline War-Rager,1,"Frontline War-Rager needs to have triggered a couple of times before it’s worth the mana you’ve invested into it. The fact that you might not be able to enable it until later in the game, and even then the payoff is very minimal, makes me think this won’t make the cut very often."
Full Bore,1,"I think that anyone who’s been traumatized by Monstrous Rage in Standard over the past two years will jump to the conclusion that Full Bore is broken. I don’t see it though. Infuriate isn’t a remotely playable card, so you really need to cast this on a warp creature to get the best value from it, and that just isn’t going to happen often enough."
Galvanizing Sawship,6,"If we’re going to play any spacecraft just for its stats, it’s probably this one. The three charge counters it needs to be active feels like practically nothing, and attacking with Galvanizing Sawship immediately is extremely powerful. However, we know from vehicles that a crew cost of more than 1 is very real, so there’s a chance this is a lot worse than it looks. I’m happy to go out on a limb and say it’s good for now and then be proven wrong."
Invasive Maneuvers,6,"Two mana for 3 damage is always great. Time has shown that this is more than efficient enough for both Limited and Constructed. Getting 5 damage from time to time is also a nice upgrade, but not one that you have to enable to play this in every red deck."
Kav Landseeker,2,"Is a 4/3 with menace for 4 mana worth playing? Not really…? Getting a Lander token that you have to use before the end of your next turn isn’t much of an upside. Kav Landseeker is a fine card, but it’s nothing exciting and you probably won’t play it most of the time."
Kavaron Harrier,4,"Since you don’t keep the token, Kavaron Harrier’s ability doesn’t do a great deal that we’re excited about. Still, I don’t need that much convincing to play a 1-drop 2/1 in any aggressive deck, and the token ability should come up from time to time in the late game."
Kavaron Skywarden,4,"Thunderhead Gunner surprised nearly everybody with just how powerful it was in Aetherdrift. It even ended the format as the best red common. This new version doesn’t work in quite the same way, but as a 4/5 reach that grows in size on some of your turns, Kavaron Skywarden is actually big enough to block most creatures, including a great deal of the spacecraft. This looks great in all but the most aggressive red decks, and even there it’s big enough that it’ll make an impact."
Kavaron Turbodrone,2,"Kavaron Turbodrone is a reasonable effect to have access to, but as a 3-mana 2/3, this is really below par. Giving +1/+1 makes a big difference here so that it remains relevant even when you’re not playing a new creature, but I still don’t see this robot being more than a slightly below average creature."
Lithobraking,3,"The ability to deal 2 damage to each creature at instant speed is something you’d probably prefer not to start in your main deck. Still, this is going to be one of the best cards you can bring in from your sideboard, and EOE Limited might end up aggressive enough that it’s worth that main deck slot."
Melded Moxite,3,"Tormenting Voice is always borderline playable. It’s the kind of card that’s never bad, but also never a priority. The game has now evolved such that we get a good amount of additional upside whenever we see it, and this is no exception. We get our card filtering up front, but we can then turn Melded Moxite into a creature later, all while being an artifact in play to support other archetypes. This is a very good variant, and we’ll see a fair bit of it."
Memorial Team Leader,2,"If you’re going wide enough, Memorial Team Leader should have a good impact on the board, but it doesn’t look much better than just average. If I went the entire format and only played this card once or twice, I wouldn’t be surprised."
Memorial Vault,1,"This looks like it could be a suitable draw engine for some decks, but Memorial Vault has a few too many downsides for my liking. It only sacrifices artifacts, not creatures. You have to play the cards in the same turn, so you can’t reliably activate this at instant speed for value. Also, 4 mana is a big cost upfront, and you might not get much from it. I’m not a fan, but there’s some potential here for sure."
Molecular Modifier,5,"These kinds of creatures tend to play out a lot better than they look. Most Valuable Slayer was very similar, not only getting in a little extra damage, but also ensuring that the best your opponent can do is a chump block. I think Molecular Modifier is very powerful, but I’ll probably end up losing to it far more often than I’ll win with it."
Nebula Dragon,4,"I remember watching a Draft video a long time ago by the one and only Luis Scott-Vargas. He’s eyeing up Ember Shot in an Odyssey/Torment/Judgment Draft and simply says, “How much am I really willing to pay for a two-for-one?” Of course he took it, as well as two more copies by the end of the pack. Anyway, Nebula Dragon looks so sweet. It’s an obvious two-for-one, but a MV of 7 might be a little too much. Still, with Lander tokens that provide you with extra ramp, I’m sure this is worth striving towards."
Nova Hellkite,8,"One-toughness creatures don’t look very safe here. Nova Hellkite is very powerful to cast for full price, but you also get a random free hit if you have 3 spare mana earlier in the game. This is great in any red deck, but it really shines in the most aggressive decks."
Orbital Plunge,4,"Six damage means Orbital Plunge will be able to kill just about any creature in Edge of Eternities Limited for just 4 mana. That’s a decent deal, even if 4 mana is a little inefficient for a removal spell. You’ll also get a Lander token a good amount of the time for a nice little bit of extra value."
Oreplate Pangolin,4,"Oreplate Pangolin looks like it could be very nasty. It’s already a 2/2 for 2, so we’re starting off strong, but it can easily attack as a 3/3 on the next turn and a 4/4 the turn after. If the red/blue artifact aggro deck is good, this will be one of the reasons for it. What a sweet card."
Pain for All,4,"Auras really do suck, but at least Pain for All has a very good ability when it enters. You can still get blown out if your opponent kills your creature in response when you cast this, but as long as you play it at a point when that can’t happen, this is just a good removal spell with a little bit of extra upside."
Plasma Bolt,6,"Any 1-mana spell that can deal 3 damage to any target is very much worth looking at twice. I don’t know how easily you’ll be able to enable the void ability on Plasma Bolt, but 2 damage is still reasonable for 1 mana, even if it’s only a sorcery. The efficiency of this card is what pushes it over the top and makes this sorcery an easy choice for the best red common in Edge of Eternities."
Possibility Technician,9,"Unlike most red cards that exile cards and allow you to play them, this card doesn’t actually give you a time limit on it, assuming you have enough kavu creatures in your deck. Given that, Possibility Technician’s ability is very close to simply drawing a card whenever it or another kavu enters. Even just by itself, this can net you two cards by simply warping in before you hard cast it. This is just a lot of card advantage in one simple package and an excellent build-around for kavu."
Red Tiger Mechan,2,"Haste creatures are good for ending your creature curve and getting a good attack in, but 4 mana for a 3/3 just isn’t quite good enough. The 2-mana warp mode is quite interesting though, so I’m sure Red Tiger Mechan isn’t completely terrible and can find a home somewhere."
Remnant Elemental,3,"What is this Remnant Elemental trying to do exactly? The +2/+0 implies it’s aggressive, but it’s a 0/4 with reach? What I really don’t like is that if you don’t have a land to play, this can’t deal any damage. This is far from the best landfall card you’re going to see, but it has just enough going for it that it’s not completely useless."
Rig for War,1,"It’s been a while since Sure Strike was last playable, and adding reach doesn’t somehow make it good again. Red has a ton of good removal in Edge of Eternities, so a weak trick like Rig for War doesn’t feel like it needs to be played."
Roving Actuator,3,"There’s quite a bit of work that you need to do to enable Roving Actuator, but there are a lot of good spells available for you to cast from the graveyard like Plasma Bolt or Invasive Maneuvers. It isn’t trivial to enable void and cast this in the same turn, but if you can put in the effort, there’s a lot of payoff here."
Ruinous Rampage,2,"With Edge of Eternities being built around artifacts, exiling all artifacts that cost 3 or less sounds good, but it’s probably a little too restrictive. This is the kind of card I’d much rather keep in the sideboard at first, but the format may very well evolve to the point that this is warranted in the main deck."
Rust Harvester,9,"Despite being a 1-drop, this is actually better the later that you play it. Getting to turn the artifacts in your graveyard into not just extra power but also removal is a great way to end the game. Rust Harvester is a little bit on the slow side, but if your opponent doesn’t have any removal for it, it’ll take over the game very easily."
Slagdrill Scrapper,2,"While drawing a card is nice, a 1-mana 1/2 is not. One-drops are often highly desirable, but Slagdrill Scrapper is just a bit too clunky and lacks impact throughout the game."
Systems Override,5,"It’s been a long time since Threaten was good. But that’s only because red hasn’t had a sacrifice theme for several sets. Whenever black/red tries to do the sacrifice thing, these types of cards are incredible. You can steal an opponent’s creature, hit them back with it, then sacrifice it so they don’t get it back. You could also use Systems Override on your own creature/artifact, which might be worth it if you do so on a big spacecraft and get it fully stationed for the turn. You probably won’t need to do that, but it’s a nice option to have."
"Tannuk, Steadfast Second",6,"Tannuk, Steadfast Second is pretty cool. Giving warp to your artifacts and red creatures doesn’t just let you cheat them out, but it also lets you cast them twice. Suddenly, cards like Nebula Dragon and Warmaker Gunship can give you a ton of extra value. Tannuk gets a bit better if you can build around it, but every red deck obviously has red creatures that you can warp out if you want to, so it’ll also be generically good in any deck."
Terminal Velocity,0,"This could be a potentially very powerful card. After all, it’s like Through the Breach plus a board wipe. The problem is that Terminal Velocity does nothing by itself. It requires you to have an artifact or creature in your hand that’s worth using with it, which isn’t guaranteed by the time you get to 6 mana. Even then, you’ll be down two cards by the end of the turn, so you need to balance that against how many creatures you might kill or what kind of value the entering creature/artifact will give you. That’s far too many things that have to go right."
Terrapact Intimidator,4,"Punisher mechanics that allow your opponent to choose your effect are historically bad. Your opponent can always choose whatever effect is best for them. Even when both modes look good, there are still downsides. When you’re flooding out, do you really need more Lander tokens? Or if you’re mana screwed, is a 4/3 really going to help that much? All that being said, the rate on Terrapact Intimidator is good enough that I think it’s worth playing, but it’s just a horribly unreliable card that’ll rarely do what you want or need it to."
Territorial Bruntar,6,"While Territorial Bruntar probably can’t do anything on the turn you play it, a free spell every time you play a land is great. As a 6-drop, a 6/6 with reach gums up the board very nicely, and then the landfall triggers help you to close out the game with a bunch of card advantage in the following turns. I love this as a nice ramp payoff, so hopefully it’ll be as good as it looks."
Vaultguard Trooper,3,"Is it just me, or does this guy look like one of those monsters from classic movies that used stop-motion animation? In particular, the Cyclops from The 7th Voyage of Sinbad? I don’t like Vaultguard Trooper all that much. I wouldn’t want to play a vanilla 5/5 for 5, and there’s no guarantee that I can even use the ability effectively. I’m sure it’s fine, and 5 power is good for stationing spacecraft, but it’s a very uninspiring card."
Warmaker Gunship,8,"I said at the start that spacecraft will probably live and die by the quality of their abilities, since stationing them takes a lot of effort. Warmaker Gunship definitely has a quality ability. Killing a creature on entering is one of the best abilities you can have in Limited. You have to put a little bit of effort into supporting it, but I imagine most red decks will have at least a couple of artifacts around to allow this to deal a fair amount of damage."
Weapons Manufacturing,7,"Weapons Manufacturing looks like a sweet build-around card. You need a lot of things for it to go right, including several artifacts and some ways to sacrifice the tokens, but the payoff you get for doing all of that is well worth it, allowing you to pretty much kill any creature your opponent plays. It could be that this enchantment requires too much work in the long run, but I’m very willing to try it out, and it even looks really fun for a Constructed deck, too."
Weftstalker Ardent,3,"This looks remarkably similar to Molten Gatekeeper, which looked like it had a lot of potential but ended up being about average. Weftstalker Ardent should be fine in an aggressive deck, though not spectacular, and it probably doesn’t even belong in any other kind of deck."
Zookeeper Mechan,4,"Red has a lot of expensive cards to play with in Edge of Eternities, so a mana dork is perfect. Zookeeper Mechan is basically a red Goobbue Gardener or Druid of the Cowl, both of which are great cards in their own rights."
Atmospheric Greenhouse,6,"I still remember Ridgescale Tusker ending up as the mythic uncommon in Aether Revolt, and I’ll never underestimate this ability again. Even though Atmospheric Greenhouse won’t be a creature right away, it’s not unreasonable to imagine distributing three or four counters immediately, which is already a big swing in your favor. If you still can’t attack, that power buff is probably enough to get it stationed at least by the next time you get to attack."
Bioengineered Future,1,"If you get to play Bioengineered Future on turn 3, you should hit enough land drops to have it active for a few turns. Except that if you play this enchantment any later than that, it starts to become more and more worthless. You can definitely play this, but I think it’s going to be far too situational to be as good as it might look."
Biosynthic Burst,2,"There are certainly worse combat tricks out there, but it’s weird that a lot of the time I’d rather trade some of the tacked-on abilities for just more power and toughness. Biosynthic Burst is playable, but not something you’ll ever want to prioritize."
Blooming Stinger,3,"Say it with me: Cheap deathtouch creatures are always good. Giving another creature deathtouch when it enters isn’t something you can surprise an opponent with very often. Blooming Stinger will just facilitate an attack with a creature that otherwise would have been blocked, but it’s still a free bonus that you’ll absolutely take."
Broodguard Elite,5,"Broodguard Elite has a lot going for it, allowing you to put quite a lot of +1/+1 counters onto the field. Unlike a lot of the other warp creatures, the fact that you keep its counters on your board actually feels like the creature doesn’t go away at the end of the turn. All that said, I feel like I’d want to be in the +1/+1 counter deck to want this insect, but it should perform very well in that home."
Close Encounter,5,"Bite spells are typically good as green’s removal option. This version is a little more flexible than most, and your opponent can’t disrupt Close Encounter by removing your chosen creature in response (there's no targeting, so the choice is made upon resolution). It’s pretty good, and you’ll happily take it early when you’re in green."
Diplomatic Relations,4,"First thing's first: This card has received errata due to being misprinted. The correct text must target one of your own creatures first, which then deals damage to another creature. As written, this would let you target an opponent's creature to damage itself or another creature, but that functionality was unintentional."
Drix Fatemaker,3,"If this were just a 4-drop, it’d probably be a little too weak, but Drix Fatemaker comes with a warp cost to help make it a lot more playable. For 2 mana, you can get a +1/+1 counter, and that creature even has trample for the turn. I'd say that’s enough of a bonus to make this a solid curve-filler for the +1/+1 counter deck."
Edge Rover,4,"This symmetrical trigger isn’t the worst thing to give to your opponent, so I’m not really looking at it as a big enough downside to stop me wanting a 1-drop 2/2. If you have an aggressive green deck like the green/white counters deck, Edge Rover is absolutely worth playing."
Eumidian Terrabotanist,5,"I’m sure to many people Eumidian Terrabotanist’s ability looks weak, but having played with similar cards in the past, I can tell you it’s incredibly annoying. I’d always play a creature of this size that gained 2 or 3 life when it entered, and this will often gain a lot more than that. While this druid is obviously designed for one of the Lander token decks, it’s still just a solid green card that I’d happily play in any green deck."
Eusocial Engineering,6,"This card design has always felt a bit lackluster in the past, like with Zendikar's Roil or Chocobo Racetrack. Expensive landfall cards never quite work out because the last thing you want after you cast a 5-drop is to then play more lands. However, Eusocial Engineering looks like a huge upgrade over its predecessors. The 2-mana warp cost is huge, allowing you to basically make a 2/2 token for 2 mana on an earlier turn of the game. Or imagine if you play this enchantment on turn 4, get a 2/2 for your fourth land drop, then pay your remaining 2 mana to sacrifice a Lander token. This looks very good to me and a great build-around card for landfall decks."
Famished Worldsire,8,"So, here’s the deal. You pay 8 mana, play Famished Worldsire, and sacrifice your eight lands. This leviathan then becomes a 24/24 with ward 3 and when it enters, you look at your top 24 cards (i.e. your whole deck at this point), and you get any number of lands you find there (the rest of them) right onto the battlefield. This is absolutely absurd! It’s a 24/24 that gives you up to 9 land drops for landfall triggers! Eight mana is a lot of course, but you only need one or two permanents with landfall abilities for this to be completely gross."
Frenzied Baloth,3,"A lot of the text on Frenzied Baloth is little more than flavor text for the sake of Limited. What we’re really looking at is double green for a 3/2 with trample and haste. That’s not bad, but it’s not all that great either."
Fungal Colossus,3,"This takes me back to Yavimaya Sojourner from Dominaria United. That was quite a bit easier to enable thanks to the set’s dual lands (it was very possible to play on turn 3), but this version should still put in some good work. Fungal Colossus is already a 5-drop in your average 2-color deck, and it shouldn’t be too hard to bring that down to 4, 3, or even less mana."
Galactic Wayfarer,4,"Three mana for a 3/3 and a useful ability is a very good deal. The Lander tokens are important for many of the strategies in Edge of Eternities, and getting a Lander as freely as this looks very strong to me."
Gene Pollinator,4,"Yes, it comes with a condition, but Gene Pollinator is still a decent mana dork. Similar cards in the past like Jaspera Sentinel have forced you to tap a creature to get your mana, but tapping any permanent to do it makes this a lot more flexible. Now, you can tap useless things like Landers, spacecraft, or whatever else. You can even tap a land if it means you get to float mana of a different color. This is awesome, and I expect it’ll play a significant role in Edge of Eternities Limited."
Germinating Wurm,3,"This is a card that makes me think I might be wrong about the station mechanic. I’m generally of the impression that getting the max number of charge counters needed to turn a spacecraft into a creature is going to be quite difficult. But then cards like Germinating Wurm come along and make me think otherwise. You can warp this for just 2 mana and end up with 2 extra life and five charge counters on your spacecraft, and that’s on top of getting to cast it later for full cost. I like this card a lot, and I expect to play it in a lot of green decks."
Glacier Godmaw,6,"This card is an absolute beating. It’s rather deceptive that Glacier Godmaw costs 7 mana, because you really want to be able to make a land drop on the turn it enters. If you do, not only does it attack as a 7/7 with haste, trample, and vigilance, but you also buff your whole team, almost like a mini-Craterhoof Behemoth. This is a very aggressively slanted green finisher."
Harmonious Grovestrider,3,"A giant vanilla creature with ward for 5 mana is… fine? Harmonious Grovestrider isn’t bad by any stretch, but without any kind of trample or evasion, your opponent can just keep chump blocking it with whatever little creature happens to get in the way."
Hemosymbic Mite,4,"On its own, Hemosymbic Mite looks fairly weak, but it’s immensely annoying if the numbers happen to line up. It isn’t hard to tap it if you have access to a spacecraft, and it can turn into a very potent threat with any kind of pump spell. Still, the fact that it does very little without that support holds it back quite a lot."
Icecave Crasher,3,"If we assume that Icecave Crasher attacks as a 5/4 with trample most of the time, it looks like quite an annoying creature. At 4 mana, it’s very well costed and a worthwhile addition to an aggressive curve."
Icetill Explorer,4,"Intrepid Tenderfoot reminds me a lot of Sauroform Hybrid. You can play it as a solid 2-drop in the early game and trade it off if needed, but it becomes a very potent mana sink when you reach the late game. Given enough time, it could be the biggest creature on the board, which is very impressive for a simple 2-drop."
Intrepid Tenderfoot,4,"Intrepid Tenderfoot reminds me a lot of Sauroform Hybrid. You can play it as a solid 2-drop in the early game and trade it off if needed, but it becomes a very potent mana sink when you reach the late game. Given enough time, it could be the biggest creature on the board, which is very impressive for a simple 2-drop."
Larval Scoutlander,4,"It’s a little too expensive these days to cast Lashwhip Predator for 6 mana, but the cost reduction should come up pretty often. You can’t enable it yourself aside from just not killing your opponent’s creatures, but it should be castable for 4 mana most of the time."
Lashwhip Predator,4,"It’s a little too expensive these days to cast Lashwhip Predator for 6 mana, but the cost reduction should come up pretty often. You can’t enable it yourself aside from just not killing your opponent’s creatures, but it should be castable for 4 mana most of the time."
Loading Zone,0,"The ability to warp Loading Zone out is kind of nice, but this enchantment does nothing unless you play something else that gives you some counters. That’s not a liability you can often afford in Limited."
Meltstrider Eulogist,6,"This is awesome. The counters deck looks very powerful and has a lot of good tools, including Meltstrider Eulogist. Any aggressive deck is bound to have its creatures die frequently, and this rewards you for that perfectly. It’s also just a great size so it can get in the red zone itself."
Meltstrider’s Gear,1,"Even if you get the first attachment for free, +2/+1 doesn’t do a great deal to help a creature survive in combat, and 5 mana is a ridiculous amount to reattach it. Meltstrider's Gear looks virtually unplayable to me, though terrible 1-mana artifacts have been known to pull their weight at times."
Meltstrider’s Resolve,5,"We’ve known for quite some time that Rabid Bite is far better than Prey Upon. Fight spells are awkward because you not only need to make sure you’ll be able to kill a creature, but you also need to ensure that your own creature survives. The +0/+2 Meltstrider's Resolve provides goes a long way towards helping that, so this is one of the better fight spells that we’ve seen. Warbriar Blessing proved its worth back in Theros Beyond Death, and I’m sure this version will be just as good."
Mightform Harmonizer,4,"Mightform Harmonizer is a rare, but it doesn’t really look like one. I’m not impressed. Doubling a creature’s power is great if the creature is already good, but it has to be fairly big and have some kind of evasion for that to be the case. Otherwise, this ability does virtually nothing. It’s still a decent size of creature, but this isn’t anywhere close to a bomb rare."
Ouroboroid,10,"This might just be the most ridiculously absurd Luminarch Aspirant variant we’ve ever seen. Right away, Ouroboroid puts a +1/+1 counter on all of your creatures. Then next turn gives two counters, then four, and so on exponentially. This wurm on turn 4 is basically impossible to beat if your opponent doesn’t kill it off immediately, and it’s probably the card I’d be most scared of playing against in EOE Limited."
Pull Through the Weft,3,"We’ve seen a lot of Restock variants, and they all play out roughly the same. They’re good to hit in the late game but clunky to draw in your opening hand. Getting two lands back doesn’t seem very relevant, though it’s a nice bonus. Pull Through the Weft will particularly stand out in the green/black graveyard decks, and the others will probably pass on it more often than not."
Sami’s Curiosity,4,"Looks like Wayfarer's Bauble is back on the menu! Sami's Curiosity is great; it accelerates you to a 4-drop on turn 3 if you have it in your opening hand, and it just gives you a simple ramp spell if you draw it later. This is one of the best versions of this effect we’ve seen for quite some time, and I expect this to be a big card in EOE Limited."
Seedship Agrarian,5,"As long as you have a spacecraft to station, Seedship Agrarian functions as its own enabler and payoff. This is perhaps the easiest way to create multiple Lander tokens over the course of a few turns, building up to one great big turn when you get three or four extra lands and all the benefits that come with it. All the while, this insect freely picks up counters just because you make your land drops. You also have some nice plays available to you where you attack, create a Lander, then that Lander functions as an on-board combat trick to push through your damage. This is a great card for any green deck but an absolute gem for the landfall decks."
Seedship Impact,4,"The abundance of artifacts in Edge of Eternities leads me to believe that artifact removal is going to be very good for the main deck. There are enough nonartifact creatures around that Seedship Impact isn’t literally Doom Blade, but it’ll feel like it is in certain matchups."
Shattered Wings,3,"Artifact removal should be good enough in the main deck, but a 3-mana sorcery isn’t the best of options. I’d love to pick up a Shattered Wings for my main deck, and others will probably start in the sideboard until needed."
Skystinger,1,"Every spacecraft except The Eternity Elevator in Edge of Eternities flies, and most of them have 8 or less toughness, so Skystinger is pretty good at fending them off. It doesn’t do much else though, and there are much better ways to deal with massive fliers."
Sledge-Class Seedship,2,"When I first saw Tapestry Warden, I thought it might be a sign that we’d get a toughness matters theme. Turns out this is the only card that cares about it, so never mind. Though this robot is essentially a 4/4, that’s not enough to make me excited to run it. About 36% of EOE’s creatures have toughness greater than their power, so it’s not a huge bonus to have."
Tapestry Warden,2,"When I first saw Tapestry Warden, I thought it might be a sign that we’d get a toughness matters theme. Turns out this is the only card that cares about it, so never mind. Though this robot is essentially a 4/4, that’s not enough to make me excited to run it. About 36% of EOE’s creatures have toughness greater than their power, so it’s not a huge bonus to have."
Terrasymbiosis,7,"I’m not fully sold on Terrasymbiosis, but this has the potential to draw you a ton of cards. Imagine curving this into a warped Broodguard Elite for example. Even if you just pick up one counter for the turn, that’s more than enough to warrant playing this. This deck is naturally quite aggressive, so a 3-mana enchantment is hardly where it wants to be. But it could draw up to a dozen cards whenever it comes down early enough, and that’s enough for even the fastest decks to pay attention to it."
Thawbringer,2,"Is this finally the time for a 4/2 for 3 mana to shine? Given how much high power matters to station your spacecraft, Thawbringer could very well do. But this design has been tried a lot of times in the past, and the fact that it trades down for 1-drops and 2-drops was always a big problem."
"Alpharael, Dreaming Acolyte",5,"Right away, an ability that draws two and discards an artifact is pretty nice to see. It’ll help you to filter your hand well enough while it leaves you a very solid creature in play. There’s not much to say about Alpharael, Dreaming Acolyte other than discarding an artifact is usually a lot better than discarding two cards. Try to make sure your deck has plenty of them, but that shouldn’t be too hard to do."
Biomechan Engineer,6,"Not only is Biomechan Engineer a good ramp enabler, but it’s also an incredible ramp payoff. That’s a rare combination to see and as a ramp enjoyer, I’m very excited to play with this card. You can’t stop me from drawing all the cards!"
Biotech Specialist,6,"Biotech Specialist looks weirdly out of place. It’s an excellent ramp card, but beyond that, it’s a sacrifice payoff. While that’s clearly to reward you for sacrificing your Landers, it’ll actually pop off the most in a black/red shell, so maybe it’s worth splashing there, too. Either way, this does look very good."
Cosmogoyf,0,"I do love to see a new lhurgoyf, but how many cards are we even going to have in exile? I’m guessing the answer is nowhere near enough to make Cosmogoyf viable."
"Dyadrine, Synthesis Amalgam",7,"Dyadrine, Synthesis Amalgam is always as big as the amount of mana you spend on it, which isn’t a bad start at all. But after that, getting to turn your +1/+1 counters into 2/2 tokens and card draw is a very powerful ability. You don’t lose any stats from your board, but you gain cards and spread that power/toughness out across multiple bodies. This is excellent, and it’s a great payoff for the green/white deck."
Genemorph Imago,6,"This is honestly just a bit weird. Blue/green is a ramp deck, which usually wants to play a slow, midrange game, yet here we have an aggro payoff for it. The most obvious use of Genemorph Imago is to target itself and get attacking, which is quite strong already. From there, it can get a bit tricksy by perhaps shrinking your opponent’s really big creature or growing other creatures you control with multiple land drops. This is a nice finisher for this deck, assuming you can keep up with land drops, but it’s also a card that deals quite a lot of damage when you play it early."
"Haliya, Ascendant Cadet",5,"The turn you play Haliya, Ascendant Cadet, you should be able to set it up such that you draw a card from it on the same turn. If you can’t, Haliya loses a lot of its value and ends up being quite clunky. Still, the counters deck has a lot going for it, so I think this soldier will be very easy to enable."
Infinite Guideline Station,0,"The Lander tokens in Edge of Eternities make casting 5-color cards easier than ever before. Except, this isn’t really worth casting in the first place. Caring about multicolor permanents when there’s very few of them in EOE in the first place is a big downside. It counts itself, but if this is the only multicolor permanent it’s not actually good enough. I’m very much a 5-color enjoyer. I’ll draft around this at some point. It’ll probably suck, but I really hope it won’t."
Interceptor Mechan,7,"Gravedigger is already a ridiculous card in Limited, and look at all of those sweet upgrades you get! You can grab an artifact, but Interceptor Mechan also flies, and it picks up counters at the end of each turn. What a card! If you can ever get two of them and one gets the other back, that’s practically a win condition all on its own."
"Mm’menon, Uthros Exile",6,"Mm'menon, Uthros Exile is certainly an easy way to get more aggressive in your blue/red deck. There are lots of good artifact creatures to build this deck around and each one of them can now come with a free +1/+1 counter. If you can play this early, your board will grow much faster than your opponent’s, and that’s an easy advantage to leverage into a win."
Mutinous Massacre,9,"Doesn’t this just win you the game on the spot? It definitely should. Yeah, Mutinous Massacre is a 7-mana card that I’m very happy to build around. On the rare occasion that you don’t outright win the game with this, all you need is a free sacrifice outlet so that you can at the very least Plague Wind your opponent out of the game and then win the next turn."
Pinnacle Emissary,8,"In an artifact-based set, we’re probably going to cast quite a few artifact spells, or at least we’d hope so. These Drone tokens are a fair bit worse than Thopters, but you get them completely for free here, so that’s nice to see. The warp cost on Pinnacle Emissary is also really dumb. You can essentially get a Drone token for 1 mana on a turn when you’re also casting another artifact, and that’s a very nice bonus to have."
"Ragost, Deft Gastronaut",4,"Ragost, Deft Gastronaut has already received a very understandable amount of love online. It does a lot of cool things, though not enough for a Limited setting. Weirdly, this is another rare that looks particularly good in the black/red sacrifice shell, so perhaps this is something you’ll look to splash in that deck rather than play it in a red/white shell."
"Sami, Ship’s Engineer",7,"The big three payoffs we always look for in build-arounds are card draw, removal, or creating tokens, so Sami, Ship's Engineer looks exceptionally good. Spacecraft make it trivially easy to tap your creatures when you want to do so, so I can’t imagine this artificer will be very hard to enable. A steady stream of 2/2s is a surefire way to win the game if unimpeded."
"Sami, Wildcat Captain",4,"A 6-mana 4/4 with double strike hits kind of hard, but that’s literally it. Granting affinity for artifacts to all your spells just isn’t relevant once you’ve already gotten the 6 mana to cast Sami, Wildcat Captain. You might be able to use this to get a big discount on some very expensive spells, but why are those cards in your deck if you can only cast them with Sami in the first place?"
Seedship Broodtender,6,"Seedship Broodtender is one of those rare occurrences where an archetypal build-around is both an enabler and a payoff. It looks fairly decent at both, though it’s a lot of mana required to reanimate something. Nevertheless, you can’t go wrong with this as a package deal."
Singularity Rupture,7,"Six mana is quite a lot for a board wipe, but Singularity Rupture is still a board wipe at the end of the day. Same rules apply; you can know that it’s coming and try not to commit too much to the board so that your opponent loses out a lot more than you do. Milling half of your opponent’s deck is certainly going to annoy a lot of people, but it’s probably little more than flavor text since it won’t mill enough cards to make enough of an impact on the game."
Space-Time Anomaly,6,"Space-Time Anomaly is going to be a very hit or miss card because playing this against early aggro is going to be horrendous. Not only because it doesn’t affect the board, but also because it’ll mill fewer cards from you having taken damage already. But if you can mill your opponent for 20 cards on turn 4 having taken no damage, won’t you just win? This is obscene against any slow deck, and even midrange decks will struggle to beat it. If you ever find a second copy, it’ll just be ridiculous. Yes, drawing this later in the game makes it a lot worse, but assuming you’re a slow, controlling deck, you should still be able to use this effectively."
Station Monitor,6,"Creating a Drone token for doing the double spell thing is a pretty good payoff. Clarion Spirit was an exceptional card in Kaldheim, but its tokens were able to block. Station Monitor isn’t going to be quite on the same level for this reason, but it’s still a great payoff for the deck and a good reason to go into UW in Draft."
"Syr Vondam, Sunstar Exemplar",9,"We just had Judge Magister Gabranth in Final Fantasy, and this is mostly the same card but with a ton of bonuses. You can sacrifice or warp creatures to enable Syr Vondam, Sunstar Exemplar directly, but just trading them off in combat is likely the easiest way to grow this quickly. Given that it turns into an easy two-for-one once you get two counters on it, you absolutely want to make sure it’s enabled. The fact is that this is a powerful bomb rare that only costs 2 mana, so it’s easy to slot into your curve or just to run out on turn 2, and that makes it a lot more desirable than many other bombs."
"Syr Vondam, the Lucent",7,"If you have any plans about going wide (and in white/black, you probably do), Syr Vondam, the Lucent is going to be one of the better curve-toppers you can find. +1/+0 and deathtouch is exactly the kind of bonus that’s threatening enough to encourage your opponent to block it while it also makes it so that they have no profitable blocks to make. That’s a very potent combination, and I expect this to be an excellent card in EOE Limited."
"Tannuk, Memorial Ensign",6,"Pinging your opponent for each land drop can get really annoying really quickly. That wouldn’t be enough to sell me on Tannuk, Memorial Ensign, but all you need to draw some free cards is some Lander tokens. If we essentially view this as something that lets us draw a card each turn as long as we sacrifice a Lander, that sounds pretty good to me."
Anticausal Vestige,9,Eldrazi are back! At least this one is. It’s also pretty incredible.
"Tezzeret, Cruel Captain",4,"Tezzeret, Cruel Captain is a weird one. The number one aspect we look for in any planeswalker is the ability to protect itself on the board, usually either by creating tokens or by making it harder for your opponent to attack into it. Tezzeret does this, but not in a particularly effective way. By untapping a creature, that creature can attack or station something and then still block for Tezzeret. That’s not all that exciting to be honest. Tezzeret looks like it’ll perform best in the green/white counters deck with enough artifacts to support it. If Tezzeret can sit back and put a +1/+1 counter on something every turn, that’s very much worth playing. Its -7 ability is also extremely powerful if you can get to it, so very much worth going for."
All-Fates Scroll,3,"Mana rocks have been quite a bit better in recent sets, and All-Fates Scroll seems just about good enough, too. You can sacrifice this artifact to draw at least two cards, but more likely closer to four or five in the right deck. I’d imagine if you end up in a multicolor deck, this’ll be good enough to run, but your standard 2-color deck won’t be interested at all."
Bygone Colossus,2,"This is a cool card. The gimmick here is that you can use Bygone Colossus to automatically station most spacecraft in one go (as most of them require nine or fewer charge counters) for just 3 mana, then maybe you have a 9/9 to play much later on if you ever get to it. I really don’t know if that’ll end up being worth it, but Edge of Eternities will be a fun format if this card is actually good."
Chrome Companion,2,"Obviously the bestest boy in EOE, but will we actually play Chrome Companion? The lifegain trigger is kind of interesting, and we can enable it by stationing some spacecraft. I’d be surprised if this saw absolutely no play, but I don’t think this adorable doggo is going to do all that much."
Dauntless Scrapbot,2,"I don’t think this is good enough. In a pinch, it can create a Lander token, so I’m sure some decks will want to run Dauntless Scrapbot for that. But it’s too fragile, and it dies in combat with basically anything. This robot should mostly be a good sideboard card against black/green decks. This can make it if you’re really short on Landers, but otherwise I just wouldn’t touch this."
"Dawnsire, Sunstar Dreadnought",7,"This is going to be the true test for spacecraft. Dawnsire, Sunstar Dreadnought does nothing when it enters, but it offers an obscene ability and set of stats behind a need for a ridiculously high number of charge counters. The more I look at Edge of Eternities, the more I’m noticing little synergies that seem to help enable cards like this and make it viable. This could easily be one of the best cards in the set, and it could also be unplayable, so I don’t know where to rate it. For now, I think it’s quite good, but you need to be able to enable Dawnsire. Cheap warp costs and cards like Monoist Sentry will go a long way towards that. This also forms a two-card instant win combo with Requiem Monolith or Pain for All, so that’s probably worth looking out for."
The Dominion Bracelet,2,"Controlling your opponent for a turn is one of the most powerful effects in all of Magic. At the very least, it allows you to force them into some bad attacks and tap them out of mana. But that cost is unbelievable. If you equip The Dominion Bracelet to a creature with 6 power, it’ll grow to 7 power and then cost 8 to use the ability. That’s still quite a lot, and I don’t see it getting much better than that. This card is cool enough that I want to hold out hope that it’s good, though to be honest, it’s far closer to unplayable than to playable."
The Endstone,8,"The ability to draw a card for every single card you play is pretty obnoxious. The big downside with The Endstone is the cost and the fact that it does very little on the turn you play it. You do have to be careful of drawing too many cards, as you can’t choose to stop drawing without choosing to stop playing any cards. All that considered, you should be able to bury your opponent in card advantage in short order."
The Eternity Elevator,1,"It’s cool to see a big Thran Dynamo-like mana rock again, but I just don’t know which deck is ever going to want The Eternity Elevator. Even a ramp deck in EOE Limited isn’t all that interested in this because the deck already has Landers and wants to get differently named lands into play. While not completely unplayable, I just don’t think this has a home outside of Constructed decks."
Extinguisher Battleship,10,"Now this is a spacecraft I can get behind. Wrath the board and probably take a spacecraft or something out at the same time. Then, Extinguisher Battleship should be comparatively easy to station, and as a 10 flampler, it gets the game over very quickly. The only thing it doesn’t do is kill off big creatures, but you can plan for that by focusing your removal on those first. Normally, costing 8 mana would be a downside, but all the Lander tokens in Edge of Eternities make me think this’ll be much easier to get to than in a normal set. This card is busted, and I hope I see plenty of it in this format (in my decks of course)."
Nutrient Block,3,"Given that we have a sacrifice archetype that wants to sacrifice artifacts, Nutrient Block looks like a very good inclusion in that deck. Much like Chromatic Star, we can just run this in the sacrifice deck, and it's essentially 1 mana to draw a card and get a free sacrifice activation. It’s also not a terrible card to run in any deck since it’s just 3 total mana to draw a card and gain 3 life."
Pinnacle Kill-Ship,3,"We often get a colorless removal spell that kills just about anything for 7 mana, and it’s never good. However, Pinnacle Kill-Ship comes with a decently-sized spacecraft attached to it, so it can turn into a legitimate win condition. It’s still over-costed for what it is, but being colorless means any deck can play it. I’m sure it’ll find a home somewhere."
Survey Mechan,4,"This activated ability is pretty sweet, so the question is whether we’re able to make Survey Mechan cheap enough to use. I’d say if your deck can make it cost about 5 or 6, this is going to be strong. You just need to be able to enable it and you’re good to go."
Thaumaton Torpedo,2,"If you have plenty of spacecraft and can enable the cost reduction on this ability, you could definitely use Thaumaton Torpedo. But a total of 7 mana to remove something isn’t worth the cost."
Thrumming Hivepool,8,"First of all, Thrumming Hivepool will always cost 6 mana since there are no slivers in Edge of Eternities other than the unplayable Sliver Overlord Special Guest. But at 6 mana, this actually looks kind of broken. It’s like a slightly worse Assemble the Legion, a virtually unbeatable rare that gives you a ton of free value over the course of a few turns. You can also play this in any deck! That’s sadly also a downside as I expect everyone to run artifact removal in the main, so this isn’t quite as untouchable as it might be in another set. It’s still very powerful, and if your opponent can’t deal with it, you’ll win the game with ease."
Virulent Silencer,2,"This is a cute way to win the game. Thankfully, Virulent Silencer doesn’t work with Drone tokens, but it certainly works with spacecraft and the like. It also stacks nicely, so multiple copies will allow you to win much faster. However, the problem is how bad this card is by itself. Given that, I don’t think this assassin will come together every time you go for it, and if you ever fall short of the 10 poison you need, it’ll feel really bad."
Wurmwall Sweeper,1,"Wurmwall Sweeper is fairly reminiscent of the essentially unplayable Sky Skiff. I think it’s a little better than that was since surveil is a very relevant ability to have, but this still falls far short of where I want my spacecraft to be."
The Planets,5,"Each of these planets has the same structure. They enter tapped, which shouldn’t be too much of a downside, then you can station them like a spacecraft. Each one has a powerful ability that you can unlock with enough charge counters."
The Shock Lands,6,"The shock lands are among the strongest dual lands ever printed. That said, they’re still only dual lands. They’ll be a great addition to your deck if you’re already in their respective color pairs, and they can help to enable splashes, but otherwise they don’t do anything useful."
Command Bridge,3,"Command Bridge is a nice variation on Rupture Spire, allowing you to tap anything to its cost, not just another land. It’s fine if you want to fix your colors, but your average 2-color deck doesn’t need fixing so badly that it’d want to play this. It’s more useful for playing three or more colors."
Secluded Starforge,6,"What looks most useful here is the ability to create a 2/2 token. As the game goes long, Secluded Starforge allows you to keep generating value to overwhelm your opponent. The slower Edge of Eternities ends up, the more a mana sink like this is going to shine."
Ancient Tomb,8,"Ancient Tomb is an all-star of Legacy and Vintage Cube. One of only a handful of “sol lands” (named after Sol Ring), accelerating you by a turn without costing you any extra cards is extremely powerful. The damage it deals can add up over time, but you only need to use it a couple of times to get ahead on the board and leverage that advantage into a win. You should probably also take it whenever you see it because it’s very expensive (about $100+ before this printing). Enjoy!"
Blast Zone,7,"A land that can trade for actual creatures is always going to be good. It might take a while to charge up your Blast Zone, but you can’t take for granted the ability to destroy something without even casting a spell."
Blinkmoth Nexus,6,"Being colorless is a very real cost (that's a theme of this bonus sheet), but creature lands are extremely powerful. Blinkmoth Nexus has proven its worth over the years, and becoming an artifact creature is often a very real upside to any artifact-based deck, which I’m sure is going to matter in Edge of Eternities."
Bonders’ Enclave,4,"Is playing a colorless land worth the upside of sometimes getting to draw a card off Bonders' Enclave? I think so, but you really need a good number of qualified creatures in your deck to make this work."
Cascading Cataracts,2,"The artwork on this is absolutely stunning. Since there’s no reason to want all five colors at once, Cascading Cataracts has very little application in Edge of Eternities, though. You can get any combination of colors, so this can help to fix for anything. But it also makes your spells essentially cost an additional mana when you use it, which is often more than you’ll be willing to pay."
Cathedral of War,2,"Noble Hierarch, this is not. Costing you not only a colored mana source but also entering tapped the turn you play Cathedral of War is quite the hefty cost just for a land that has exalted. While that’s a bonus, the cost of playing this is likely too high."
Celestial Colonnade,7,"The name “Celestial Colonnade” probably made this a very easy pick for EOE. Colonnade is excellent, and one of Magic’s best ever creature lands. Not only will this be a premium pick if you’re drafting blue/white, but I’d for sure splash this if I was in either white or blue. The Lander tokens even make it easier to splash whichever color you’re missing."
Contested War Zone,6,"If you’re an aggressive go-wide deck, a land that buffs your damage output by this much is extremely powerful. This is of course why Contested War Zone comes with the hefty downside of having to pass it to your opponent if you take damage. Still, that risk is worth it in the right deck."
Creeping Tar Pit,7,"Of the original cycle of creature dual lands, Creeping Tar Pit was easily the most annoying to deal with. An unblockable 3/2 ends the game pretty quickly, and your opponent can only answer it with instant-speed removal. This is another land that I’d always take to fix my mana, but I’d also likely splash for it if I was only in one of its colors."
Crystal Quarry,0,"There are two 5-color cards in EOE Limited, and both are basically unplayable. It’s not worth playing Crystal Quarry to fix for anything else, so it’s just not worth playing at all."
Deserted Temple,0,The only combos I can see here involve untapping a creature land to block with or untapping Lotus Field or one of the planets that taps for a lot of mana. Neither of those things is worth the cost of putting Deserted Temple in your deck.
Dust Bowl,0,"Sacrificing your own lands to destroy your opponent’s lands isn’t really what you want to be doing here, especially when you can only target nonbasic lands. They might not even have any! Dust Bowl is just a straight no from me."
Echoing Deeps,0,"EOE Limited doesn’t have a lot of graveyard interactions in the first place, so which lands are even going to be in your graveyard? Typically none, so Echoing Deeps doesn’t look remotely playable."
Eldrazi Temple,0,"There’s only one Eldrazi creature in Edge of Eternities, and it actually gets worse when you accelerate it out. Eldrazi Temple is an easy no from me."
Endless Sands,1,"It seems simple in principle. Exile creatures you control with good abilities or to save them from removal spells, then get them all back in one go. Sadly, when we last saw Endless Sands, there was a lot of hype around it and it fizzled out very quickly."
Gemstone Caverns,0,"This is an excellent reprint to see as its price was starting to climb out of reach for anyone who wants it for Modern. While accelerating you on the draw is a very good effect, I don’t think it’ll be worth going down a card to enable that. In Modern, Gemstone Caverns is used a lot in combo decks to speed them up when going second. In the absence of any such decks in Limited, I think this is probably just garbage."
Grove of the Burnwillows,4,"I’ve been wanting a playset of Grove of the Burnwillows, and this absolutely stunning artwork is a great reason to finally pick some up. In Limited, this is fine. It’s about as close to a dual land with no downsides as you’ll ever see, but you obviously don’t need it unless you’re already red/green."
High Market,4,"Gaining 1 life is an embarrassingly weak ability, but getting to sacrifice a creature isn’t. We have a lot of payoffs for doing this, so a land like High Market in our land base that can sacrifice something without ever having to cast a spell does actually sound quite good."
Hissing Quagmire,4,"A 2/2 deathtoucher is a weird stat line for a creature land, as you tend to prefer to attack with them, not block. Hissing Quagmire is one of the weaker cards in this dual land cycle. I wouldn’t look to splash one of its colors, but I’d look to take it fairly highly if I was already in black/green."
Inkmoth Nexus,6,"This is a mythic rare for very good reason here. While Inkmoth Nexus is a very small creature and seems innocuous, the way this card has always been used throughout its history has been as something to carry equipment, +1/+1 counters, or other buffs. Because it has infect, it’ll kill your opponent a lot quicker than any other creature might. If you have a deck that can do that, Inkmoth looks great, but it needs that support for it to work properly."
Inventors’ Fair,5,"Gaining a tiny amount of life each turn isn’t much, but trading a land in for an artifact from your deck has the potential to be very good. We wouldn’t play a spell that does this, but a land like Inventors' Fair has far less of an opportunity cost to put it into a deck."
Lavaclaw Reaches,4,"Much like Hissing Quagmire, this is one of the weaker lands in this cycle, and not something I’m going to go out of my way to put into my deck. I’d love to see Lavaclaw Reaches if I’m already black/red, but that’s it."
Lotus Field,3,"While Lotus Field is a broken land in some Constructed formats, it does very little in Limited. It’s not much better than just playing your land drop for the turn as normal. It fixes your mana a bit, so that’s nice, but entering tapped makes it little better than an Evolving Wilds."
Lumbering Falls,4,"Lumbering Falls is another creature dual land that’s just fine. Four mana for a 3/3 hexproof creature isn’t all that impressive, so you’ll play this if you’re already blue/green and not otherwise."
Mana Confluence,4,"Fixing any color with an untapped land is very good, but the life loss is a very real cost. Unlike something like Starting Town, you can’t turn off the life loss at any point unless you just stop using it. But still, Mana Confluence enters untapped and lets you keep your curve going. If you need the color fixing, this is a good card to enable that."
Meteor Crater,0,"Without a colored permanent in play, not only does Meteor Crater not tap for any color of mana, it doesn’t even tap for mana at all. This is obscenely bad and should never be anywhere close to your main deck."
Mirrorpool,3,"Mirrorpool is an interesting one here. On the one hand, creating a copy of a creature or copying a spell on the stack is a pretty strong ability. However, there are some hefty downsides. This is colorless and enters tapped, which are pretty bad. It also requires colorless mana, so you shouldn’t play it at all without some sources of colorless mana. The effect is powerful enough that it’s worth going for, but there’s a lot of pieces here that need to come together before it works."
Mutavault,6,"One of the classic creature lands, Mutavault has seen a lot of play over the years in various typal decks like faeries, merfolk, etc. We don’t have a great deal of type-specific synergies in Edge of Eternities, but 1 mana to attack as a 2/2 is still a decent ability. It’s colorless, but at least it doesn’t enter tapped to slow our curve down."
Mystifying Maze,6,"While this is a lot of mana to have to leave up, attacking into Mystifying Maze is so annoying. It keeps big creatures in check, makes combat tricks worse, and everything in between. In EOE in particular, it’s also very good at disrupting spacecraft, as they’ll return to the battlefield without their charge counters. They retrigger their abilities in some cases, but that’s not so bad for a majority of them if you disrupt them in this way."
Needle Spires,4,"This creature dual land is also very fair and not all that powerful. Four mana for a 2/1 double striker is just fine, so Needle Spires will be good in a red/white deck and not worth playing elsewhere."
Nesting Grounds,1,"Although we have a +1/+1 counter theme that looks quite good, there’s not a lot in that archetype that rewards you for putting counters on your creatures. Nesting Grounds is very good when you have creatures that, for example, trigger an ability when they get a counter, so you can use this land to keep triggering them. Those creatures just aren’t in Edge of Eternities, so the power of this card is severely limited. While not completely useless, I just don’t think it’s good enough in the context of this set."
Petrified Field,0,There’s no land so good that sacrificing Petrified Field to bring it back to your hand is going to be worth doing.
Plaza of Heroes,2,"Plaza of Heroes is a very powerful land that has seen a lot of Standard play over the last few years, but Edge of Eternities has a lot fewer legendary cards than many other sets, so I don’t see this doing a lot for you. It certainly could happen, and this is very good if it does. But most of the time this will fall short of the mark."
Power Depot,4,"Power Depot is actually quite interesting in the context of Edge of Eternities. It’s the only artifact land, so triggering certain abilities with a land drop is highly desirable. You also have the ability to sacrifice it and get a free +1/+1 counter from modular. Not every deck will care about this, but there are definitely some that’ll love to have it."
Raging Ravine,6,"Raging Ravine is a cut above some of the other dual lands in this cycle. I’ve played a lot of this both in Standard and Modern, and it’s one of my favorites. Right away, this attacks as a 4/4, then it’s a 5/5, and so on. Funnily enough, you also have a trick whereby animating it twice gives it two instances of the trigger, so you can pick up two counters in one attack."
Reflecting Pool,2,"Reflecting Pool was once one of the best lands in Standard; when it was combined with Lorwyn’s vivid lands (Vivid Grove for example), it was an untapped source of all five colors, and 5-color control was a very good deck at the time. As it stands, this doesn’t help to fix your colors all that much in your average Limited deck since it only gives you colors that you already have. Where this is good is in the deck that cares about controlling lands with different names, as this has basically no downsides. It just doesn’t really have any upsides either."
Scavenger Grounds,0,"There’s one graveyard-based archetype, and it doesn’t even use the graveyard all that much. Exiling graveyards isn’t something we likely care about doing, so I don’t think Scavenger Grounds is even worth it out of the sideboard."
Shambling Vent,5,"Lifelink is such a relevant ability that this is a cut above some of the other creature dual lands. You still wouldn’t splash for it, but Shambling Vent is very powerful, and something you should prioritize if you’re in the right colors."
Stirring Wildwood,4,"This is a little more efficient than some of the other duals in this cycle, but a 3/4 reach creature isn’t particularly exciting at any point. A lot of EOE’s flying creatures are the spacecraft, and most of them are quite a bit bigger than Stirring Wildwood, too. Still, if you’re in green and white, you’ll happily take this to fix your mana and sometimes get in the red zone."
Strip Mine,6,"Okay, here’s Strip Mine, among the most toxic and hated lands in the game. If you have this in your opening hand and destroy your opponent’s first land with it, there’s a tiny chance that you actually just win the game. Your opponent could have kept a hand that needs to hit a land drop to be playable, and now they need to hit another one. I’d assume this is good enough to run, and sometimes you’ll just spike a game with it. It’s also worth remembering that Icetill Explorer exists in Edge of Eternities and could theoretically go nuts with this."
Sunken Citadel,4,"Sunken Citadel is essentially an Evolving Wilds, and that’s perfectly fine. You can use this to fix any color you need, and you should basically play this in any deck. When to pick it in a draft is another question entirely, because it’s not quite good enough to want to pick up too early. But if you happen to see it later in the pack and the other cards suck, slam it and be happy about it."
Swarmyard,7,"There are quite a few insects in Edge of Eternities, and Swarmyard is a pretty exceptional card if it has targets. The fact that it costs no mana to activate is just obscene. It’s so easy to leave this open, and now your opponent just can’t interact with some of your creatures. It’s especially potent with aggressive creatures, so something like Genemorph Imago goes really hard with this. Obviously, this is unplayable if your deck has no insects, but with just a couple of them this will be incredible."
Terrain Generator,0,"Terrain Generator would be incredible if it fetched lands from the deck, but putting them into play from the hand just isn’t good. You could use this on turn 3 and you probably have a land to put into play at that time, but that’s so much worse than just playing any 3-mana creature. I don’t think this is remotely good enough to see any play."
Thespian’s Stage,2,"There are a few good utility lands that you can copy with Thespian's Stage, but unfortunately they’re all on the Stellar Sights bonus sheet, so you’re probably not going to see that many of them in a draft. It’s good that you can copy an opponent’s land though, so I’m sure you can find some uses for it."
Wandering Fumarole,4,"Wandering Fumarole is also on the weaker side of these creature lands. It’s very good if you’re blue/red, but there’s no need to go out of your way to play it in another deck."
Deafening Silence,0,Deafening Silence is just never going to be relevant to play in a format where players are playing mostly creature spells anyway.
Robe of Stars,6,"Getting to protect a creature by phasing it out at will sounds incredibly strong. Even better, it’s very cheap to do so. Equip Robe of Stars to one of your bomb rares or just any big creature, and it’s going to be very hard for your opponent to ever interact with it."
Nexus of Fate,6,"Time Warp is an incredibly powerful card. In Limited, Nexus of Fate often lets you take two combats while it lets you untap, draw a card, and everything else associated with taking that turn. In most sets, the idea of casting a 7-mana extra turn spell isn’t too enticing, but the existence of Lander tokens makes this a lot more interesting. I don’t think the ability to keep shuffling it back into the library will be that important, but it’s not nothing."
Paradox Haze,0,Paradox Haze does literally nothing unless you have something very specific to pair with it. That simple fact doesn’t equate to a playable card at all.
Darkness,0,"While Darkness is a cool and needed reprint, Fog just isn’t playable in Limited. You can craft all sorts of beneficial scenarios for it, but they’re infrequent and almost never worth spending a whole card to enable."
Magus of the Moon,0,"Magus of the Moon’s ability to turn nonbasic lands into mountains isn’t an effect we’re remotely interested in, and we’re even less interested in a Gray Ogre."
Burgeoning,0,"Spending a card to get ahead on mana seems very reasonable. After all, cards like Rampant Growth and Farseek are very powerful. The problem is having to rely on having the land in hand for this to work. If you play Burgeoning turn 1, you can have three lands out for turn 2, but this has little or no guarantee of working at any other point in the game."
Green Sun’s Zenith,2,"Creature tutors tend not to be playable in Limited, as paying extra mana on top of their mana cost typically isn’t worth it. I’m giving Green Sun's Zenith a little bit of credit here for being so cheap to do this, but I’m definitely not sold on the idea."
Sliver Overlord,0,"There are no slivers in Edge of Eternities. Technically it’s not useless, as Thrumming Hivepool exists and this can counter it by stealing the Sliver tokens, but that sounds like a situation so rare that it’s not even worth considering. How does a worse Fusion Elemental sound?"
Warping Wail,1,"Warping Wail was fairly decent when it was first printed in Oath of the Gatewatch. It has a wide enough range of modes that it’s bound to do something reasonable whenever you draw it. The difficulty is that getting the colorless mana required to cast it is a lot harder in Edge of Eternities, so I don’t think this’ll be worth going out of your way to play."
